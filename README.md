# OrangeHRM-Project
Project Title:OrangeHRM Automation Testing using Selenium and Python.

Project Overview: In this project, I worked on automating the testing for OrangeHRM, a popular Human Resource Management System. My goal was to ensure that key features like logging in, adding employees, and verifying their details function correctly without manual testing. I used Selenium WebDriver and Python to create automated test scripts.

What I Did:

* Automated Login: Created test scripts to automatically log in using valid credentials to verify the login process.
* Employee Management: Built tests to add new employees and verify their appearance on the “Employee List” page.
* Worked with Dynamic Elements: Used XPath and CSS Selectors to interact with elements that change on the page.
* Error Handling: Implemented error-handling logic to ensure smooth execution and clear test results.

Technologies Used:

* Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.
* Python for scripting test cases.
* ChromeDriver to run tests in the Chrome browser.
* WebDriverWait for handling page loading and dynamic content.
* XPath and CSS Selectors for locating web elements.
